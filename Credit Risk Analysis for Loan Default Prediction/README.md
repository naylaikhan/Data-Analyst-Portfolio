# üìä Credit Risk Analysis for Loan Default Prediction

## üèÜ Project Objective

Analyze credit card customer data to identify factors driving loan defaults and detect high-risk customer segments.
Outcome: Help organizations improve credit risk management, reduce financial losses, and optimize credit policies.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

25 variables: demographics, credit limits, repayment status, bill amounts, payment behavior.

Target Variable: default.payment.next.month

1 ‚Üí Customer defaulted

0 ‚Üí No default

## üìà Key Analyses & Insights
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Credit Limit (LIMIT_BAL) Distribution

Most customers: 50,000 NT dollars

Long-tail distribution: very few high-credit customers (>1,000,000 NT)
Insight: Risk mitigation should focus on low- to mid-income customers.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Age Distribution & Default Rates

Majority: 25‚Äì30 years

Lowest default rate: 30‚Äì45 years (20.75%)

Highest default rate: 60+ years (26.84%)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Average Payment Delay vs. Default

Majority (1,432 customers) have zero delay

Non-defaulters show higher average delay, indicating possible data scaling issues

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Default Risk by Education

| Education Level | Default Rate |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Graduate School | 19.23%       |
| University      | 44.86%       |
| High School     | 25.16%       |
| Others          | 0.47%        |

Insight: Prioritize educated customers; stricter checks for less educated groups.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation

LIMIT_BAL vs. avg_pay_delay: +0.353

Interpretation: Higher credit limits mildly correlate with longer payment delays

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ High-Risk Segments
| Age Bucket | Education Level | Marital Status | Avg Payment Delay | Avg Credit Limit | Default Rate |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 60+        | University      | Others         | 1,667             | 60,000 NT        | 100%         |
| <30        | Graduate School | Others         | 6,353             | 116,250 NT       | 50%          |

‚Ä¢ Extreme risk: 60+ University, Others marital status ‚Üí 100% default

‚Ä¢ Younger <30 Graduate School, Others marital status ‚Üí 50% default

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. Data Quality: Investigate anomalies in avg_pay_delay & ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù marital status

2. Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest using key variables

3. Risk-Based Credit Policies: Define thresholds and approvals

4. Targeted Mitigation: Create repayment plans for high-risk groups

## ‚ö° Conclusion

Actionable insights help organizations:

‚Ä¢ Identify high-risk customers

‚Ä¢ Prevent defaults

‚Ä¢ Implement data-driven lending policies
