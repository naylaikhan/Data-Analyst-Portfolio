## 🎯 Objectives

Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

Apply K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups.

Evaluate multi-channel campaign performance (web, catalog, store).

Generate marketing insights & recommendations for campaign optimization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL → Data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering.

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → EDA, RFM scoring, clustering, and visualization.

Power BI / Tableau (optional) → Dashboarding customer insights.

## 📊 Key Steps

### Data Preparation

Cleaned and pre-processed marketing campaign dataset.
Engineered features such as Total Purchases, Total Spend, Recency.

### RFM Analysis

Ranked customers into quartiles for Recency, Frequency, Monetary.
Built RFM Score to classify high-value vs. low-value customers.

### Clustering

Standardized RFM variables.

Applied K-Means clustering (Elbow method used to determine optimal k).

Labeled segments with business-friendly names: Loyal High-Value, At Risk, Potential, Occasional Shoppers.
