### Hotel_Booking_Analysis_Dashboard

üéØ Project Overview
A comprehensive end-to-end Power BI dashboard built around hotel bookings data, focusing on clean insights and interactive visuals.

Scope:

‚Ä¢ Data cleaning & transformation
‚Ä¢ Data modeling (including date/calendar tables)
‚Ä¢ Metrics calculation using DAX
‚Ä¢ Advanced visualizations
‚Ä¢ Multiple report pages for different analysis angle

üìã Dataset & Data Model

Data Source:
Historical hotel booking dataset (CSV/Excel, similar to Kaggle dataset)

Key Fields:

‚Ä¢ Booking ID, Hotel, Booking Date, Arrival Date, Lead Time, Nights, Guests
‚Ä¢ Distribution Channel, Customer Type, Country, Deposit Type
‚Ä¢ Status (check-out or canceled), Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, etc.

Modeling:

‚Ä¢ Cleaned via Power Query
‚Ä¢ Calendar/Date table created for time intelligence
‚Ä¢ Relationships between bookings table and Date table

üìä Core Metrics & DAX Measures
Typical DAX formulas include:

Total Bookings = DISTINCTCOUNT of Booking IDs
‚Ä¢ Successful Bookings = COUNTROWS filtered on Canceled = 0
‚Ä¢ Cancelled Bookings = COUNTROWS filtered on Canceled = 1
‚Ä¢ Occupancy Rate = Successful Bookings √∑ Total Room Capacity
‚Ä¢ ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR
‚Ä¢ Revenue Loss due to cancellations
‚Ä¢ Weekly/monthly YoY or MoM comparisons

üìà Dashboards & Pages
The project consists of multiple report pages covering:

KPI Summary Dashboard
‚Ä¢ Key metrics at a glance: Occupancy Rate, ADR, RevPAR, Total Revenue

Overview Dashboard
‚Ä¢ Time trends in bookings & revenue
‚Ä¢ Booking pattern by channel, guest country

Geographic Breakdown
‚Ä¢ Top 5 countries by bookings/revenue, distribution via maps

Booking Channel & Customer Analysis
‚Ä¢ Insights comparing direct vs OTA vs offline agents
‚Ä¢ Corporate vs Transient analysis

Cancellation Analysis
‚Ä¢ Cancellation trends, loss estimation, correlation with deposit & country

Operational Metrics
‚Ä¢ Avg. length of stay, busiest months, resource allocation insights

üõ† Tools & Techniques
Power Query: Data cleaning (e.g., date/timestamp fixes, type corrections)
DAX: Advanced measures for KPIs and ratio calculations
Visualizations: Cards, line/bar charts, maps, slicers, tables. Possibly advanced visuals if installed

üîó Business Insights & Recommendations
Based on the dashboard, the key recommendations include:

‚Ä¢ Strengthen relationships with OTAs since they drive 80%+ bookings
‚Ä¢ Require minimum 50% deposit to lower cancellation rates
‚Ä¢ Target high-value markets (e.g., Portugal, UK, Germany, France, Spain)
‚Ä¢ Run promotions like ‚Äústay 4 nights, pay for 3‚Äù to increase stay duration
‚Ä¢ Staff up for peak seasons (peak check-ins in March‚ÄìOctober; high check-outs in Oct‚ÄìNov)
